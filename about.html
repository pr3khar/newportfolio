            Hi! I am Prakhar Prasad, a third-year undergraduate at IIIT Delhi,
            pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Computer Sciences with Social
            Sciences. I have a keen interest in technology and design. The field
            of interaction design fascinates me, ever since I read Don Norman's
            Design of Everyday Things. As the saying goes, "Simplicity is the
            ultimate sophistication." I believe in making aspects coherant,
            bringing depth and detail, while retaining simplicity and visual
            acuity.
            <br /><br />
            Apart from this, I can cook a pretty good biryani (trust me, it is
            seriously good!) I also enjoy reading and my friend, Paulo Coelho
            never fails to inspire me. On the sports front, Hala Madrid naya ya
            Mas!
